> An amazing colour scheme, focused on "*usefullness*".

The colours are:

- White
- More white
- Even more white
- Even even more white
- Even even even more white

Just look at it in action!

## Benefits

***Still*** not convinced? Here are some reasons why you should choose this theme:

### Distration-free

Gets rid of all the distracting... *colours*.

### You're coding, not painting rainbows

Not an artist (well, maybe), white is good enough.

### Looks great at lower brightness

It looks amazingly the same on lower brightnesses, meaning you can save some battery!
